Watercolour Curious is a kit containing a carefully curated palette of watercolour paints that enables beginner and experienced artists to experiment with new pigments.  

Each seasonal palette is a set of 4 colours that capture the mood of the season and that are hand curated to work well together.  I include only high-quality, professional artist grade paints and try to select unique single pigment colours that are normally not found in beginner sets.

Included with each palette is a Discovery Sheet that provides guided exploration of different ways to mix the paints to create an inspiring range of hues and shades. The kit also includes two pieces of heavy weight 100% cotton watercolour paper, so you can use the results of your colour exploration to create your own beautiful, vibrant artwork on artist quality paper.  

Below, you can see the palettes that I have developed, and the kits are available to purchase in [my Etsy shop](https://www.etsy.com/uk/listing/1428603973/watercolour-curious-crocus-palette).
