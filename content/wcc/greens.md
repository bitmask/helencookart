This palette is inspired by the myriad greens of summer. 

Summer brings an explosion of new growth, and a whole palette of green foliage. Included in this kit are two very different blues and a lemon yellow, which together will mix a wide range of greens. Lastly, a mid red rounds out the palette and will beautiful neutralise the greens.

These colours  on their own remind me of bright sunny days at the beach, with turquoise water, blue sky, yellow umbrellas, and red sand pails.

The discovery sheet will guide you through mixing many shades of green, and show you how to use these colours to their best effect.
Finally, I pull all of this together into an example painting, which you can follow along with, or make your own work!

#### Example Paintings

For this painting of a patch of yellow crocuses, I wanted to capture the gesture of growth from bottom right swooping up to the top of the page.  I also wanted to exaggerate the browns in the image all the way to a magenta to add in the complementary colour for the yellow.
