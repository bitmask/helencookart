This is a test video without showing my account name and profile pic.  If you click on the title it goes to that video on my vimeo account.  If that's not ok, I can turn off the title (and also the like, watch later, share buttons on the rhs since these buttons also go to vimeo), so that you'll just have an embedded video.
