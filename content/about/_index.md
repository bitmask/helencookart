I am a scientist turned watercolour artist living in Cambridge, UK. 

My art centers on observing the small moments of joy in life that are often overlooked.  My training as a biologist has honed my skill at observation, and living with chronic migraines has taught me that even amid suffering, there is joy in observing with curiosity and wonder.  My watercolours express the moments of joy found in observing the natural world.  I am fascinated by the interactions of colours and the contrasts of forms, and paint to make them bold and large on the page.  These moments are always present, and expressing them is a reminder to myself that it is valuable to take the time to look for them.
