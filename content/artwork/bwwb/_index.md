The series Black Windows, White Bombs is a series of monoprints on handmade nettle paper and focuses on anti-colonial and anti-racist themes. I repeatedly use the simple shape of an arched window, and turn it upside down to evoke a bomb or bullet. This imagery calls out the mindset that other people simply existing is cause for violence against them, and denounces the reprehensible idea of finding safety in persecuting others. 

This series was displayed at Cambridge Artworks during the exhibition [Gathering Pages](/nettlepaper/exhibitionwalkthrough) on Feb 14-16th 2025.
