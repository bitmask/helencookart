This is a series of coloured glassware sitting in various configurations on the window sill of my studio.  The glass reflects the colours of its surroundings, and distorts the forms that we see through it.  How does our own appearance change when we are in the presence of others?  What do we distort, with purpose or not?

I've written a [post that goes into more detail]({{< ref "/blog/transparency" >}}) about the inspiration for this work.
