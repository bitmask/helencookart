This series presents scenes of various pieces of glassware that reflect the colours of their surrounding, and that distort the forms that we can see through them.  The work invites reflection on how we interact with our surroundings.  What do we reflect that changes our appearance? What do we distort?

I've written a [post that goes into more detail]({{< ref "/blog/transparency" >}}) about the inspiration for this work.
