This series of watercolour paintings is an experiment in pushing the boundaries of watercolour.  I am combining wax resists, painting loosely with granulating pigments and an extreme amount of water, and watercolour frottage, using plants from my garden to emboss the page.  

All of these works are painted in reaction to natural processes that I let develop.  I am not prescribing an image from the beginning, but am allowing the image to develop slowly as I add layers.
