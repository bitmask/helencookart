This series talks about moving through uncertain and unreliable conditions. Trying to find your way through with everything changing around you. Searching, waiting, wandering, looking, walking through a landscape with uncertainty everywhere. The ground could drop away, or a piece of the sky could fall to fill a chasm at any moment. When you look away and look back, things have shifted around.
