Work that is not part of a series.  Includes watercolours I painted from 2020 to mid 2021. Several of these paintings were developed under the mentorship of Professor Clara Lieu and the [Art Prof community](https://artprof.org) community in the process of completing the [painting](https://artprof.org/learn/tracks/painting-basics-track/) and [colour](https://artprof.org/learn/fundamentals/color/color-track/) tracks.
