Painting a portrait is a search for connection.  Finding the form and gesture of the face requires intensely looking, an alost uncomfortable, but empathetic scrutiny.  Many of these portraits are painted using only a 1" flat brush as an experiment in looseness and expression.  Many of them also use reductive techniques to create areas that dissolve and that are weathered.
