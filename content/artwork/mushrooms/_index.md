I am fascinated by the forms of oyster mushrooms, which grow abundantly in the early winter in Cambridge.  I've done a series of studies from this cluster in watercolour looking at the subtle colours in the mushrooms and the granulating pigments that can represent them.  I additionally did a series in watersoluble graphite focusing on the repeating patterns in the gills and transforming the cavernous forms into otherworldly places.
