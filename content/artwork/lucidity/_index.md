This series of watercolour paintings was developed during an artist residency with in situ: theatre from May to June 2023. 

Themes and imagery of Ibsen's play, *The Master Builder*, are reflected throughout this work, especially the themes of falling and the control of destiny. The double exposure images present faces in two moments in time, one as a sleepwalking state, and the other as a moment of clarity that sees through the fog.
 
My work with portraits comes primarily from a drive for connection with people. I am interested in the line between abstraction and representational work -- how few brush strokes can we attribute personality to and/or see ourselves in? Abstraction provides a broad mirror, and it also serves to make the moments that are detailed stand out as more personal in contrast.
