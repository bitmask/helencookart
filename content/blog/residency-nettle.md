I'm excited to announce that I'll be spending two weeks in the Cambridge Artworks caravan for a summer residency from Aug 27 to Sept 9.  I'll be making nettle paper and inviting people to have a conversation with me about their relationship with paper.  Paper is a tool for making art, but also a tool of building empire.  How does the relationship change when each page isn't a crisp white rectangle, but has its own personality?  How does it change if it's locally produced by hand?  How does it change if it's given, not bought?  I'll invite people to select a page and to record their thoughts in words, pictures or abstraction, and then will bind all the pages together into a book.
