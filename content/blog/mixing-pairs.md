How I mix these colour swatches.

I cut these out of an imperial sheet of Arches 300 gsm cold press watercolour paper.  They are 3 cm wide with 3 mm borders, so each square is 24 mm^2.  

Choose the colours that will be mixed together.  

Paint the triangles for the top and bottom.  My convention is that the cooler colour goes on top.o

I mix all the steps in the blend on a palette with individual wells first, starting with the darkest value and test each of the colours on a separate paper before committing to the WC paper. Then I paint the darkest triangles, let them dry, and I use the remaining paint on the palette to dilute down. So each part of the square comes from the same mix to ensure it's really the same hue (make sure to mix enough).

I pay attention to how the paint moves on the palette to make the different values of each hue. The darkest ones are thick enough that brush strokes will be visible in the paint for a moment before flowing closed, if that makes sense. Then the mid wash is dilute enough that the paint moves more like water. I feel like I'm still trying to perfect this and I sometimes go back to touch them up where they were too light the first time, or lift some if they were too dark.

For the lightest value on the X strips, it's about the same amount of water again as going from the darkest to the mid values. A really light wash, but not too light. It takes some time to develop a feel for it, but eventually you'll be able to be consistent. 

Doing this exercise in WC will teach you more about mastering WC technique than about the colour. I mean, you will also learn about colour, but there is SO much to learn about using WC. If you attempt it, you're in for a big challenge -- big learning opportunity, big chance to be frustrated.  If you want to play with the colour in easy mode, try acrylics I guess.
