Colour is a positive obsession of mine.  When I was young, I can remember having to put my crayons in order by colour before I would want to draw with them.  I still have a compulsion to do this, and to collect as many as possible.

Watercolours, along with most paints and solid media like coloured pencils and pastels are coloured by the addition of pigments.  Pigments are used in contrast to inks or , which are coloured with dyes.  Pigments are solids that are suspended in a liquid, whereas dyes are soluble.  Pigments tend to be more lightfast and are larger particles.  I'm not so into dyes because of the type of art I do, but let me tell you about my pigment library.

Paints are marketed as a single colour, but this colour can be either a single pigment, or a mix of different pigments.  For my colour experiments, I'm only interested in the single pigments because I can mix all the others if I can get their components also as single pigments.

There are many variables that determine how a paint behaves and what a colour looks like that can vary between manufacturers, or between different paints by the same manufacturer.  
Particle size, vehicle, amount of pigment, etc.
I would love to get some Qor watercolours, because they disperse a lot more readily than the others I've swatched.

I have swatched every single pigment watercolour from Daniel Smith, Schmincke, and Winsor and Newton.  (Every one that is included on their dot cards, I think a few are missing.) This gives me the ability to compare pigments across brands, and to see how each pigment behaves on the paper.

I think of this as first order colour. 
Since watercolour can be diluted, each single pigment paint can express a range of colours from light to highest chroma, to darkest.  For some paints the last two points will be the same, but others that are very dark will need to be diluted slightly to reach their highest chroma.
Compare single pigments of the same hue.  
compare granulating to non-granulating pigments, and also how they mix.

It's my goal to measure these and to have a tool that will plot them in the Munsell colour space.  Eventually.

The second order is to mix each colour with each other colour.
This will create a line through the hue/chroma projection, which expands to a volume in value. 
Increasing in complexity, but also in usefulness.  
This is an extremely long project, but it will be interesting to compare the mixed colours to the single pigments.
See how mixing colours farther away reduces the saturation of the mixed colour
See how mixing colours is darker (hard because I can dilute it)

Third order is then creating a volume, which is an area in hue/chroma and of course varies in value. 
Find the 3 pigments that mix the largest gamut
Find the 6 pigments that mix the largest gamut
Are they the same pigments?
There are probably many sets
