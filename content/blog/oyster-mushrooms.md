We went out just before Christmas to a patch of woods off the busway where years ago an oak log fell.  The log has been cultured with Pleurotus ostreatus and fruits prolifically after rain and cold.  The mushrooms are delicious and have the curious property that they contain a compound that will inhibit sweet taste receptors.  Sugar tastes vaguely sweet, but mostly just grainy.  It's a strange sensation, and I always wait to have dessert after eating these mushrooms!

Their forms are fantastic, sculptural and nearly proud.  I explored these with a series of watercolours and then also some graphite studies of the textures in the gills on the underside of the caps.  I really enjoyed the subtle colours that make up the mushrooms, and have pushed the colour a bit farther in each image, and in the last one I've used Purpurite from the Daniel Smith Primatek series.  I used exclusively granulating paints in these images, as I thought the grittiness of the paints was appropriate for the grittiness of the mushrooms.  How often do you find one that doesn't have a bit of dirt on it?  There are very few red granulating paints.  I started with PBr11, a highly granulating burnt sienna colour, then moved into PR233 Potter's pink.  Instead of mixing the purple, the only place to go then was to the granulating purples.

For the graphite studies, I really enjoy seeing the forms as almost abstract figures.  The directionality of the gills flows and curves, and the light on the surface makes them feel cavernous in places.  

Mushrooms are a great subject, one I'm sure I'll revisit.
