I put together this accordion fold book.  The cover measures 12x12 cm and the paper inside is about 11x11 cm.  The paper I got from a bookmaking course that I did early 2020 at the [Cambridge University Botanic Garden](https://www.botanic.cam.ac.uk). We made a few books, and were able to take home extra paper.  I knew this was a cotton paper and I assumed it was watercolour paper, but after painting a few pages, it became clear it was printmaking paper.  Printmaking paper is sized (the glue in paper is called size) to be very absorbant, whereas watercolour paper is more heavily sized to make the paint stay on the surface and be easier to manipulate.  Painting this to get smooth areas was a real challenge.
