You are welcome to join me this July for Cambridge Open Studios.  Two months away seems like a long time in advance to make plans, but a very short time to prepare everything that I'm excited to show you. My garage will be converted into a display space to show my new series of more experimental watercolours, and there will be tea in the garden.  Come by, see my new work, and stay for a chat.  

There will be a private view in the evening of the first Saturday, July 6 from 5-8pm, which, if you are reading this then you are invited to.  Then the space will be open to the public during standard Open Studios times on the 1st and 3rd weekneds, July 6-7 and 20-21, 10am-5pm. I'm entry number 80 in the Open Studios guide. 15 Acton Way, Arbury, Cambridge, CB4 3SD.
