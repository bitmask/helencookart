I have been working on a collaboration with [Elspeth Owen](http://elspethowen.net) since December 2023.  Each week, we search for and exchange photographs of colours that inspire or move us in some way.  

{{< asset src="fridays-colour/poster.png" link="/wcc" caption="All 32 colours on a poster">}}

We wanted to share these photos more widely, so I designed prints of each of the photos which would show which week they were taken and by whom. For each photo, I also pulled out one representative colour  I grouped them into thematic collections, and designed a book that documents the whole project.

We exhibited at the Grantchester Art Fair this last weekend.  Thank you to everyone who came and took home a piece of this project!  Those of you who purchased a book -- do get in touch if you would like it signed.  

We will also be showing at Open Studios, Elspeth the 2nd and 3rd weeks of July, and the 1st and 3rd for me.
