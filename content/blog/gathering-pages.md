My summer residency in the Cambridge Artworks caravan was a huge success.  I spent the first two weeks solidly making paper.  From the 7 or 8 kg of nettles that I gathered, I made about 40 A6 sheets to pass out to folks who were interested in contributing to the book.  Many people were interested, so the book contains contributions from 14 artists (one got lost in the mail!). Additionally, there was still interest after I bound the book, so there will be a volume 2 or appendix with between 4 and 8 pages (depending on how many come back in time).  

Fortunately, the residency was able to be extended by a week, and in that time, I was also able to make about 40 A5 pages. 10 of these I've bound into a sketchbook that I've been taking into the woods to find interesting textures and patterns, and the remaining 30 I'm using for a new series that speaks more to the anti-imperial and anti-capitalist themes of the nettle paper project. 

It was a great experience to have a new place to work, to have conversations with a bunch of lovely people and to get some perspectives on how my work is received. 

I'm going to be showing these works on nettle paper at Cambridge Artworks in an exhibition called Gathering Pages on February 8-9 11-5. There will also be an opening on the Friday, Feb 7 6-8.
