John Singer Sargent (1856 - 1925) was a prolific oil and watercolour painter known for his economy of brushstrokes.  I wanted to do this mastercopy to understand how he is able to create shape and depth from such a small number of strokes.

I chose to make this the same size as the original (45.5 x 30.5 cm) so I was sure I was working at the same scale and would have the same experience.  

I drew out the image in pencil, which tbh, I would have done anyway, but there are traces of pencil in the original, so I can claim to be following the same process.  

I tried to put down the lines working confidently and boldly

I noticed well into the painting that my brushes made smaller marks on the paper than Sargent's, so they didn't fill volumes as well.  My painting feels a bit empty, where the original feels like it's bursting with colour.  In my painting since doing this exercise, I've started using larger brushes and I'm starting to feel that they improve my painting.
