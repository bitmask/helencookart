I have been thinking a lot about the idea of transparency recently. 
Things that are transparent are often made of thin and fragile material, they can be see-through, nearly invisible and overlooked.
But to be transparent in a personal relationship is to be truly seen, the exact opposite of being overlooked.

Although being seen by a partner feels very vulnerable, this leads to strength and protection, in contrast to the vulnerability of a fragile vase.

If this isn't safe or consensual, it is a scrutiny and a violation -- the panopticon has no solid walls.

Transparency in politics is a foundation for trustworthiness and accountability -- the German parliament is made of all glass.  

Who is the observer, and who has the power?

In this series, I'm interested in exploring the small scale, the intimate.  Glass objects arranged as in a still life will reflect the colours of their interlocutors.  A blue vase viewed through a brown bottle will appear green.  A straight line will appear curved, a shadow on a surface will become a pattern of lines.  Complexity emerges from the conversation. Playing with the edge of abstraction, forms are reduced to just colour, but crisp lines remain as an anchor to reality.
