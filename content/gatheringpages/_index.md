During my 2024 summer residency at [Cambridge Artworks](cambridgeartworks.com), I refined my process for making paper from stinging nettles. 

I invited folks to select a sheet of nettle paper and to use it to record their thoughts in words, pictures, or abstraction, thinking broadly about paper and our relationship to it. I have bound the contributions together into a book, Gathering Pages. Due to the popularity of this project, the book was quickly followed by a second volume.  

My heartfelt thanks to everyone who contributed their creativity, time and effort.
