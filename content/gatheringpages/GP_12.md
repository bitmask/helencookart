notes: I dreamt I built a banded lobster pot and left it in the jungle of Thesta // And hauled it in to see what I had got if what is was was what I'd hoped it to be // It wasn't great mounds of pirate treasure abandoned by a tempest blasted crew // Nor sprawling bullion valued out of measure by those who lost their breath to stack it true // It wasn't jewels in mindless combination forgotten when the same sink with the rest // Nor tomes of tyrants tireless conjurations reluctantly abjured (and for the best)
