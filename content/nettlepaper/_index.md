I make handmade paper from stinging nettles. 

During a residency at [Cambridge Artworks](cambridgeartworks.com) I refined my process for making paper from stinging nettles. I invited people to work on the pages that I made, and this work is collected into a book called Gathering Pages. 

I am currently taking pre-orders of nettle pages for 2025.
