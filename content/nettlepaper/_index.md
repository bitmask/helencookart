## Handmade Paper from Stinging Nettles

Since 2023, I have been handmaking paper from stinging nettles. I use nettles foraged on Midsummer Common in Cambridge, UK, and I follow a process I have pieced together through trial and error, learning from folks who use nettles for textiles, and from folks who make paper from other fibres. The process is documented in my [pamphlet "Making paper from Stinging Nettles"]({{< ref "/nettlepaper/pamphlet" >}}), which is available for purchase, and in a [60 second video]({{< ref "/nettlepaper/video" >}}) of the whole process, from plant to pulp to paper. 

The nettle making process was developed during a residency at Cambridge Artworks.  I made paper for 3 weeks in the summer of 2024, and invited the people around me to choose a page to work on in images or words.  I have bound all the contributions together into a [book called Gathering Pages]({{< ref "/gatheringpages" >}}). 

This work was shown in an exhibition called "Gathering Pages" at Cambridge Artworks on Feb 14-16 2025. Here is a [walkthrough of the exhibition]({{< ref "/nettlepaper/exhibitionwalkthrough" >}}). 

I am currently taking [pre-orders for nettle pages]({{< ref "/nettlepaper/order2025" >}}) to be delivered in October 2025.
