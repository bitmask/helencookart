# Explore colour space

## Colour paths

Lines drawn through the Munsell colour space intersect colours that form harmonious palettes.  Use this tool to explore paths that traverse the space in terms of hue, value and chroma, or any combination at once.  Export palettes and enjoy colour harmonies.

## Palette gamut

Limited palettes are an effective means of achieving mood in paintings.  Plot the colours used in artworks sourced from wikiart in the 3D Munsell colour space, or upload your own.
